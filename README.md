# Short-term bitcoin market prediction via machine learning

The Short-term Bitcoin Market Prediction via Machine Learning explains the predictability of the bitcoin market over time horizons ranging from 1 to 60 minutes. There is an elaboration of the multiple machine learning models tested and discovered. While all models outdo a random classifier, recurrent neural networks and gradient boosting classifiers are particularly well-suited for the investigated prediction tasks.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. In this study, the authorâ€™s look at the bitcoin market's short-term predictability. Machine learning methods are progressively being used in this domain. Bitcoin accounts for approximately 58 percent of the cryptocurrency market, with a market capitalization of roughly 170 billion US dollars (September 2020). This research paper answers whether machine learning models can predict short-term movements in the bitcoin market by comparing six well-established machine learning models trained on nine months of minutely bitcoin-related data against each other. The findings show that trained models outperform random classification.
